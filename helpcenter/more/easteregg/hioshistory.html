                    <p class="card-text">
                        HiOS has existed for a number of years, with the project first being started as a basic HTML-based hotel kiosk interface that would run inside a C# and Cefsharp container, with development starting mid-July 2021.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Then after a few iterations of the original HiOS, we stopped updating it until it was discontinued in late March 2022 as the first version of project 'Unified' (aka HiOSUnified) was in development.
                        In the meantime, we released the first version of HiOSMobile (known back then as HiOS(tm) Mobile) in December 2021. We also released the first iteration of HiOSMobileWeb in February 2022 which was used as the temporary replacement for the original HiOS.

                    <p class="small">The first iteration of HiOSMobileWeb</p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Project Unified was released in late May 2022, touted as 'the most modern HiOS yet', etc.
                        It had a new Montenegrin lake-inspired translucent design, equipped with integration with your smartphone app.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Then in November 2022 we released a followup to the old HiOSMobileWeb with a second iteration with a more modern design and navigation drawer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Then in February 2023 we released HiOSUnified2 to replace the Montenegro version above, and we also created a new replacement for the second iteration of HiOSMobileWeb (known as THCMobileWeb), based on our new design language with a bottom nav bar.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        In July 2023 we released HiOSMusic, a fork of InnerTune, then in August HiOSWeather.
